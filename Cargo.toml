# TODO: Currently, there is not a way to mark a dependency as binary-only
#       and the workarounds suggested are:
#
#       1. Make binaries as examples instead and use dev-dependencies (bad)
#       2. Make binary dependencies as optional features that are required
#          by the binaries (bad)
#       3. Use workspaces to separate out binaries and library (overkill)
#
#       Until I reach the point where I'm actively distributing this library,
#       I'll ignore the problem and bring everything in to the library.
